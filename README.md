case study-2
Problem Statement:
> Build a Python code to display messages according to the temperature received from an assumed IoT system.
> Accept max and min limit temperature.
> Generate random values for temperature at every 2 second interval.
> Compare with the limits to display appropriate value.

Sample Output : 

Enter minimum temperature: 20
Enter maximum temperature: 50

Current Temperature: 13
Alert: Temperature is too low

Current Temperature: 41
Temperature is within acceptable limit

Current Temperature: 43
Temperature is within acceptable limit

Current Temperature: 58
Alert: Temperature is too high

Current Temperature: 95
Alert: Temperature is too high

Current Temperature: 42
Temperature is within acceptable limit
